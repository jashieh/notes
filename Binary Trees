What is in-order/pre-order/post-order traversal of a tree?
What is Depth-first/ breath-first search of a tree?


Binary Search Tree
* Left child is less than
* Right child is greater than or equal to parent

How does a tree balance itself?

Are recursive calls on the call stack considered towards space complexity?

# Heaps
What is a heap?
* A partially ordered data structure.
* Root of tree is either max or min (max or min heap)

## Max Heap
* Children of a node are less than or equal to parent

## Min Heap
* Children of node are greater than or equal to parent

What are the implications of heap data structure?
* In a max heap, the root will be greater than its children, grandchildren, etc. recursively

How do you insert into a heap?
* Insert at farther left as possible then swap up to furfil heap property.

How do you delete from a heap?
* Delete Node
* Pick farther right node in heap
* Swap with larger child for max heap, smaller child for min heap recursively

How do you represent a heap as an array?
* Node = i (starting at 1)
* Left child = 2*i 
* Right Child = 2*i + 1
* Ex: [null, 42, 32, 24]

What is a complete Tree? 
* All levels besides bottom level is filled with nodes
* Bottom level has children filled to the left as much as possible
