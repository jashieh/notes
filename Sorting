## Selection Sort
### What is selection sort?
* finds the next smallest element and swaps it to the front, similar to bubble sort
What is the speed of selection sort? 
* (O(n^2))
What are the advantages of this sort?
* Advantages: least number of swaps, useful if write speed is slow

## Insertion Sort
### What is insertion Sort?
* finds next unsorted item and inserts it to the left of the array where it belongs

What is the advantages of this sort?
* Linear runtime if the array is already sorted. Good for streamed data where the array is constantly growing.

## Radix Sort
### What is Radix Sort?
* Sort integers by comparing 10s place, then 100s, then 1000s, etc.
* Place Numbers in "buckets" from 0-9 based on the current comparing place
* Sorting algorithm for binary/integer data

Steps
* Get digit at specific place: Math.floor(Math.abs(num) / Math.pow(10, place)) % 10
* Get number of digits: Math.floor(Math.log10(Math.abs(num))) + 1; 1 if num === 0;
* Find max number of digits: loop through array and use num digits function

What is the advantages of radix sort?
* Fast sorting algorithm (O(n*k) where k is length of longest number and input length)


## Counting Sort
### What is counting sort?
* Integer sorting method
* Allocate array that is length of largest int in array
* Increment value in counting array when number is encountered in input
* Loop through counting array and print out sorted array.

Advantage of counting sort?
* Fastest sorting algo (O(n + k) where k is the largest integer in the set)

Disadvantages?
* Takes a large amount of space
