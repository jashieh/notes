* Prototyped based
* Multi-paradigm
* Single-threaded

if settimeout 0. function in timeout will still execute after rest because the code is run instantly

### HTML
* hightlight: <mark></mark>
* reverse test: <bdo dir="rtl"></bdo>
* doctype: ensure browser renders html in standard mode
* Window vs document: document is part of window (html, php, etc)
* reflow:  computes the layout of the page/ layout change.
